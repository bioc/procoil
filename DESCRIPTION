Description: The package allows for predicting whether a coiled coil sequence
	     (amino acid sequence plus heptad register) is more likely to form
	     a dimer or more likely to form a trimer. Additionally to the
	     prediction itself, a prediction profile is computed which allows
	     for determining the strengths to which the individual residues
	     are indicative for either class. Prediction profiles can also
	     be visualized as curves or heatmaps.
